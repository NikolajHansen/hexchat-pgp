Recipe for a c++ based plugin to hexchat - the irc client. 

Name: hexchat-gpg
Description: Secure chat via GPG on irc via hexchat.
Language:c++

1. Should use the prefix /GPG for plugin calls
2. Should have a LRU cache for storing emails as a key and GPG public keys. Put this in its own sourcefile.
3. If an attempt at finding an email in the LRU cache is not successfull attempt to populate it with a lookup to the pgp public directory.
4. Should have a management GUI for entering your own email and GPG public key. put this in its own sourcefile
5. Should be able to load a private key from disk in order to encrypt a message. The location of which should also be part of configuration.
6. Only attempt to decrypt a message from another user if the message starts with HEXCHAT_GPG
7. Should have an internal list of emails to query based on the userlist in a channel to see, if the user is on the list of recipients to recieve encrypted messages. put this in its own sourcefile
8. Commands needed
	/GPG config : opens the config form for the local users email, public key and location of the private key.
	/GPG addrecipient <irc handle> <email> : should add a recipient to the recipient list.
	/GPG deluser <irchandle> : removes a user from the recipient list.
	/GPG listusers : lists the content to the local user.
	/GPG on : turns on encryption functionality.
	/GPG off : turns off encryption functionality
9. config should be persisted in ~/.config/hexchat
10. Generate a makefile for building this
11. Generate a markdown description of the plugin for github
12. If encryption is turned on only send message to recipients on the recipient list.
13. if encryption is of turn off all crypto functionalty and go back to vanilla hexchat behaviour.
